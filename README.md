# Emotion Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent Emotion Detection system that can analyze input data and accurately identify human emotions. Depending on the modality used (text, audio, or image), the system leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality.

## Features

- Multimodal emotion recognition (Text / Speech / Image)
- Preprocessing and feature extraction
- Deep learning-based classification models
- Real-time or batch prediction
- Visualization of detected emotions

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow 
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV 
- Streamlit (for optional web app interface)

## Applications

- Sentiment and mood analysis
- Customer feedback systems
- Mental health support tools
- Smart assistants and chatbots
